Substrings can be extracted from strings using the command ‘substring’.
```
sentence = “Computer Science.”
partSentence = sentence.substring(3, 3)
print(partSentence)
```
The print statement would return ‘put’ as the first number is the start index and the second one is the number of characters to extract.
