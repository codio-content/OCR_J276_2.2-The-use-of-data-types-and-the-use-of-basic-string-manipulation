Computers must be aware of the data type of the values stored in variables so that data is interpreted and manipulated correctly.

In some programming languages, the type must be declared but in other languages, the type does not have to be stated. The type is inferred from the type of data first stored e.g. age = 21 would imply that the variable ‘age’ stores integers.
