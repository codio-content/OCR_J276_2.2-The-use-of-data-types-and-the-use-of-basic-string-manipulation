The command in OCR pseudocode is:
    ```nameOfString.length```

It is used in the following code:
```
sentence = “Computer Science.”
stringLength = sentence.length
print(stringLength)
```

The number 17 would be printed as there are 17 characters including the space and the full stop. (The 17th character is at index position 16 as 0 is the first index position).
